# Angular Fast Http Caching

Uses HTTP Angular (asynchronous) Observables with RxJS (JS version of Reactive library) and browser local storage to show a locally cached version of API data. This is replaced by real data once the network request has completed. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## Notes

"Observables are a new way of pushing data in JavaScript. An observable is a Producer of multiple values, “pushing” them to subscribers."
